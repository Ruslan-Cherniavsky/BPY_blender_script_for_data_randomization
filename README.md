Blender Animation Augmentation Add-on for Machine Learning and Computer Vision
Overview
The Blender Animation Augmentation Add-on is a tool designed to generate augmented visual data by randomizing the position and distance of a camera rig from an object within Blender. This tool aims to facilitate the creation of diverse datasets for machine learning and computer vision applications by providing functionalities to generate varied viewpoints and distances between the camera and objects in a scene.

Features
Randomized Camera Position: Allows randomization of the camera's position around the object.
Variable Distance Control: Enables randomization of the distance between the camera and the object.
Augmented Data Generation: Generates diverse visual datasets suitable for machine learning and computer vision tasks.
Blender Compatibility: Compatible with Blender software for easy integration into existing workflows.
Installation
To install the Blender Animation Augmentation Add-on:

Open Blender and navigate to Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons.
Click Install and select the downloaded ZIP file.
Enable the add-on by checking the checkbox next to its name in the Add-ons list.
Usage
Open Blender and select the object(s) you want to augment.
Navigate to the Add-on panel or menu within Blender.
Set the parameters for camera position and distance randomization.
Run the add-on to generate the augmented visual data.
Export the augmented data for use in machine learning or computer vision tasks.
Parameters
Camera Position Randomization: Specify the range or constraints for randomizing camera positions around the object.
Distance Variation: Set the range or constraints for varying the distance between the camera and the object.
Example Workflow
Load the object(s) to be augmented into Blender.
Set the desired range for camera positions and distance variations.
Run the add-on to generate a series of augmented scenes.
Export the scenes as images or video frames for use in training machine learning models or computer vision algorithms.
